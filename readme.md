This is the data pack for a minigame created on the legitimoose.com minecraft server.
This repo serves to make the code transparent as well as allow people to submit pull requests for new features in the game.
You are not allowed to download it and rehost your own version of the game. Be original guys!

I won't accept every pr, it's still my game, which is why you might want to make an issue first.
